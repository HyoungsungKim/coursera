# Week 1 - Module 1

## Lesson 1: Cloud Computing

### Perils of corporate Computing

- Own information systems
- However
  - Capital invesment
  - Heavy fixed costs
  - redundent expenditures
  - High energy cost, low CPU utilization
  - Dealing with unreliable hardware
  - High levels of overcapacity (technology and labor)
- Not Sustainable

### Cloud Computing

What is a cloud?

- Anybody can use it from anywhere
  - Availability is good
  - Accessibility is good
- On-Demand Network Access

### Delivery Models

How the services of the clouds get delivered to the customer

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - use provider's applications over a network
  - SalesForce.com
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Deploy customer-created appications to a cloud
  - AppEng
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - hardware
  - Rent processing, storage, network
  - Capacity and other fundamental computing resources
  - EC2, S3

#### Big Data Data revolution and Clouds

- Data collection too large to transmit economically over internet == Petabyte data collections
- Computation is Data Intensive
  - Losts of Disks, Networks and CPUs
  - Overhead of maintaining cyber infrastructure is expensive
  - Users buy Big Data services from Clouds to share overhead
  - ***Easy to write programs, fast turn around***
  - MapReduce - Hadoop, PIG, HDFS, HBase
