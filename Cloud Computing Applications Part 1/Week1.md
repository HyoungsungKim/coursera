# Week 1 - Module 1

## Lesson 1: Cloud Computing

### Perils of corporate Computing

- Own information systems
- However
  - Capital invesment
  - Heavy fixed costs
  - redundent expenditures
  - High energy cost, low CPU utilization
  - Dealing with unreliable hardware
  - High levels of overcapacity (technology and labor)
- Not Sustainable

### Cloud Computing

What is a cloud?

- Anybody can use it from anywhere
  - Availability is good
  - Accessibility is good
- On-Demand Network Access

### Delivery Models

How the services of the clouds get delivered to the customer

- Software as a Service (SaaS)
  - use provider's applications over a network
  - SalesForce.com
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
  - Deploy customer-created appications to a cloud
  - AppEng
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - hardware
  - Rent processing, storage, network
  - Capacity and other fundamental computing resources
  - EC2, S3

#### Big Data Data revolution and Clouds

- Data collection too large to transmit economically over internet == Petabyte data collections
- Computation is Data Intensive
  - Losts of Disks, Networks and CPUs
  - Overhead of maintaining cyber infrastructure is expensive
  - Users buy Big Data services from Clouds to share overhead
  - ***Easy to write programs, fast turn around***
  - MapReduce - Hadoop, PIG, HDFS, HBase

### 1.1.3 Cloudnomics: Part1

#### Cloudnomics: Part1

Economics necessitates Cloud Computing:

- Part 1: utility Pricing
- Part 2: Benefits Common Infrastructure

#### Value of Utility Pricing

- Cloud services don't need to be cheaper to be economic!
- Consider a car
  - Buy or lease for $10 per day
  - Rent a car for $45 a day
  - if you need a car for 2 days in a trip, buying would be much more costly than renting
  - ***It depends on the demand***

#### Utility Pricing in real World

- In Practice demands are often highly spiky
  - News stories, marketing promotions, product launches, Internet flash floods (Slashdot effect), tax season, Christmas shopping, etc.
- Often a hybrid model is the best
  - You own a car for daily commute, and rent a car when traveling or when you need a van to move
  - But we should also consider other costs
    - network cost (both fixed costs and usage costs)
    - Interoperability overhead
    - Consider Reliability, accessibility

### 1.1.5 Big Data

#### Big Data(A singular phrase!)

- A collection of data sets so large and complex, it's impossible to process it on one computer with the usual database and tools
- Because of its its and complexity, Big Data is hard to capture, store, copy, delete(privacy), search, share, analyze and visualize

Big Data represents the information assets characterized by such a High

- Volume,
- Velocity and
- Variety

to require specific Technology and Analytical Methods for its transformation into Value
