# Basic Computer Science Fundamentals

## Orientation Towards Cloud Computing Concepts:Some Basic CS Fundamentals

> Cloud Computing Concepts : C3

## 1. Basic Datastructures

#### Queue

First in First out(FIFO)

#### Stack

First in Last out(FILO )

### 2.  Process = A Program in action

When main function is instantiated and executed, it becomes a process. When function is executed, then it is stored in stack. When function return, then stack pop function.

Local variable is stored in stack. Dynamic allocation is stored in heap.

### 3. Computer Architecture(Simplified)

Accessing register is faster than accessing a cache(But pretty fast)

Accessing speed

Register > Cache > RAM

Storage size

RAM > Cache > Register

### 6. DNS(Domain Name System)

- collection of servers, throughout the world
- Input to DNS: a domain name(e.g. coursera.org)
- DNS server return IP address of web server

### 7. Graphs

node(vertex), edge, edge-weight
